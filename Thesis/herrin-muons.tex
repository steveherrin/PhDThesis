\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:muon:motivation}
One potential source of background in EXO-200 is unstable isotopes of common elements, created by neutron activation. The largest source of these neutrons is spallation by cosmic ray muons. Indeed, EXO-200 is located underground to reduce cosmic activation. The energy loss rate \((d E/d x)\) for relativistic muons has a broad minimum between \SIlist{1;10}{\GeV}, and increases slowly for higher energies. Therefore, some muons produced in the upper atmosphere can still travel deep underground.

Neutrons from these muons can capture on detector materials or the HFE, producing high-energy gamma rays that might Compton scatter in the detector and leave behind energy close to the Q value for \xenon{136}. These gamma rays are prompt, and so can be vetoed if the muon can be tagged. A neutron capture on \xenon{136} produces \xenon{137}, an isotope that beta decays with a Q value of 3.8 MeV, which means the beta particle produced in the decay could have an energy close to the Q value of \xenon{136}. The half life of \xenon{136} is 3.8 minutes, and so vetoing becomes more difficult. But a good measurement of the muon flux can put constraints on the amount of \xenon{137} decays observed.

\section{Identifying Muons}
\label{sec:muon:id}
Muons that reach underground have typical energies of \SIrange{1}{100}{\GeV}, a range in which they are minimally ionizing. Those that pass through the detector typically leave a straight line of ionization along their path. Like any energy deposition in EXO-200, some of the energy deposited becomes scintillation light, while the remaining ionization is drifted and collected. Thus, a muon passing through EXO-200 will show a bright flash of light, followed by ionization across many wire channels, linearly spread in time. \Cref{fig:muon:eventdisplay} shows a typical example. This distinct linear trail provides a means to tag the muon.

\subsection{Identifying Muons with the Hough Transform}
The Hough transform\cite{Hough:1959fk}\cite{Duda:1972:UHT:361237.361242} is an algorithm originally used to look for tracks in bubble chamber photos. A line can be completely parameterized by the angle \(\eta\) it makes with an axis, and the perpendicular distance \(r\) from the line to the origin. The Hough transform maps a pixel in an image to all possible lines that can pass through that pixel, which looks like a sinusoidal curve in \((\eta, r)\) space. If some of the pixels form a line, then these curves will converge at the point corresponding to that line.

This can be applied to EXO-200 to look for muons. First, ionization deposits are identified by simply looking at the collection wire channel waveforms and looking for the waveform rising a set threshold above its baseline. A ``hot spot'' is associated with the time value at which the waveform peaks above this threshold. The induction wires are analyzed the same way, except looking for the waveform dipping below its baseline. The Hough-transformed hot spots are placed in a histogram, and the bin with the most entries is used to reconstruct the projection of the muon's track onto the wire planes. \Cref{fig:muon:houghtransform} shows an example.

The middle panels shows the identified hot spots in the waveforms in black, and the reconstructed tracks in red. The lower panels show the Hough transforms of the hot spots above, which converge on the point corresponding to the red line above.}

\end{figure}

After passing a check for noise (described in \Cref{app:noisetagger}) and a check for a large amount of scintillation light, an event will be tagged as a muon if it has good tracks in both the induction and collection wire planes in at least one TPC. A ``good'' track must be reconstructed from at least 5 hot spots that lie along the reconstructed track, or at least 3 hot spots along the track if fewer than 5 total spots were found.

The Hough transform reconstructs the projection of the muon's path onto the wire planes. Since the drift velocity and wire spacings are well known, these projections can be translated back to an incident angle for the muon.

\subsection{Validation with Monte Carlo Simulations}
In order to validate this muon tagging algorithm, 2 million muons were generated in the EXOSim GEANT4 simulation of the EXO-200 detector. The overall efficiency of the tagging depends on the angular distribution of the incident muons (for example, one could imagine a pathological scenario in which all muons were parallel to the wires in one plane). The angular distribution underground is approximated\cite{miyake:1973} by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_angular_distribution}
\frac{dN}{d\Omega} \propto \left (\cos \theta \right)^{1.53}e^{-8\times10^{-4} h \left(\sec \theta -1\right)}
\end{equation}
where \(\theta\) is the zenith angle and \(h\) is the vertical depth in \si{\hecto\gram\per\square\centi\meter} (\SI{1}{\hecto\gram\per\square\centi\meter} is equivalent shielding to one meter of water).

The energy distribution for muons underground can also be approximated\cite{Mei:2006qy} by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_energy_distribution}
\frac{dN}{dE} \propto e^{-8\times10^{-4} h\cdot 2.77}\left(E+693\left(1-e^{-8\times10^{-4} h}\right)\right)^{-3.77}
\end{equation}
for energy in \si{\GeV}.

For a particle incident from zenith angle \(\theta\) and azimuthal angle \(\phi\), the effective area of a cylinder on its side is
\begin{equation}
A(\theta,\phi) = \pi r^2 |\cos(\phi)|\sin(\theta) + 2 r h \sqrt{1-\sin(\theta)^2 \cos(\phi)^2}
\end{equation}
when \(\phi=0\) is parallel to the cylinder's axis and where \(r\) is the cylinder's radius and \(h\) is its height.
