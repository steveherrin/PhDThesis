\chapter{Muons}
\label{ch:muons}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:muon_motivation}
One potential source of background in EXO-200 is unstable isotopes of common elements, created by neutron activation. The largest source of these neutrons is spallation by cosmic ray muons. Indeed, EXO-200 is located underground to reduce cosmic activation. However, the energy spectrum of muons produced in the upper atmosphere has a long tail at higher energies, and so some of the muons produced in the upper atmosphere can still reach deep underground.

Neutrons from these muons can capture on detector materials or the HFE, producing high-energy gamma rays that might Compton scatter in the detector and leave behind energy close to the Q value for \xenon{136}. This process occurs on millisecond timescales, and so the gamma ray can be vetoed if the muon can be tagged. A neutron capture on \xenon{136} produces \xenon{137}, an isotope that beta decays with a Q value of \SI{3.8}{\MeV}, which means the beta particle produced in the decay could have an energy close to the Q value of \xenon{136}. Likewise, the (n,~2n) reaction on \xenon{136} can produce \xenon{135}, which beta decays with a Q value of \SI{1.2}{\MeV} and is is a background for the two-neutrino mode. The half lives of \xenon{137} and \xenon{135} are \SI{3.8}{\minute} and \SI{9.1}{\hour} respectively, and so vetoing becomes more difficult. But a good measurement of the muon flux can put constraints on the amount of both isotopes expected.

\section{Identifying Muons}
\label{sec:muon_id}
Muons that reach underground have typical energies of \SIrange{1}{1000}{\GeV}, a range in which they are minimally ionizing. Those that pass through the detector typically leave a straight line of ionization along their path. Like any energy deposition in EXO-200, some of the energy deposited becomes scintillation light, while the remaining ionization is drifted and collected. Thus, a muon passing through EXO-200 will show a bright flash of light, followed by ionization across many wire channels, linearly spread in time. \Cref{fig:muon:eventdisplay} shows a typical example. This distinct linear trail provides a means to tag the muon.

\subsection{Identifying Muons with the Hough Transform}
The Hough transform\cite{Hough:1959fk}\cite{Duda:1972:UHT:361237.361242} is an algorithm originally used to look for tracks in bubble chamber photographs. A line can be completely parameterized by the angle \(\eta\) it makes with an axis, and the perpendicular distance \(r\) from the line to the origin. The Hough transform maps a pixel in an image to all possible lines that can pass through that pixel, which looks like a sinusoidal curve in \((\eta, r)\) space. If some of the pixels form a line, then these curves will converge at the point corresponding to that line.

This can be applied to EXO-200 to look for muons. First, an event must pass a simple scintillation cut. The sum of the individual APD waveforms must sum to at least 10000 ADC units, which is  above the typical signal associated with gamma and beta events under \SI{3}{MeV}. Next, ionization deposits are identified by simply looking at the collection wire channel waveforms. The first 256 samples are averaged to find the baseline.  A ``hot spot'' is associated with the time value at which the waveform peaks, once it has climbed 80 ADC units above the baseline. The induction wires are analyzed the same way, except looking for the waveform dipping 80 ADC units below its baseline. The hot spots undergo a Hough transform, and the curves are placed in a histogram. The bin with the most entries is used to reconstruct the projection of the muon's track onto the wire planes. In the event multiple bins have the most entries, meaning the best track does not quite line up with the binning, the median of the bins (sorted by \(\eta\)) is used. \Cref{fig:muon:houghtransform} shows an example of a reconstructed muon track.

The middle panels shows the identified hot spots in the waveforms in black, and the reconstructed tracks in red. The lower panels show the Hough transforms of the hot spots above, which converge on the point corresponding to the red line above.}
\label{fig:muon:houghtransform}
\end{figure}

After passing a check for noise (described in \Cref{app:noisetagger}) and a check for a large amount of scintillation light, an event will be tagged as a muon if it has good tracks in both the induction and collection wire planes in at least one TPC. A ``good'' track must be reconstructed from at least 5 hot spots that lie along the reconstructed track, or at least 3 hot spots along the track if fewer than 5 total spots were found.

The Hough transform reconstructs the projection of the muon's path onto the wire planes. Since the drift velocity and wire spacings are well known, these projections can be translated back to an incident angle for the muon. However, some information is lost in the time projection. For example, all muons incident from (\(\theta,\phi) = (\theta, \pm\pi/2)\) pass parallel to the wire plane. All their charge arrives simultaneously on the wires. While the signal is distinctive and will be tagged as a muon, there is no way to determine \(\theta\). Likewise, a muon may pass parallel to a wire. In this case, it may not create enough hot spots to be tagged as a muon, or some ionization may reach perpendicular wires, leading to a reconstruction in a perpendicular direction.

\subsection{Validation with Monte Carlo Simulations}
In order to validate this muon tagging algorithm, 2 million muons were generated in the EXOSim GEANT4 simulation of the EXO-200 detector. The overall efficiency of the tagging depends on the angular distribution of the incident muons, for the reasons described above. The angular distribution underground is approximated\cite{miyake:1973} by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_angular_distribution}
\frac{dN}{d\Omega} = \Phi(h) \left (\cos \theta \right)^{1.53}e^{-8\times10^{-4} h \left(\sec \theta -1\right)}
\end{equation}
where \(\theta\) is the zenith angle and \(h\) is the vertical depth in \si{\hecto\g\per\square\cm} (\SI{1}{\hecto\g\per\square\cm} is equivalent shielding to one meter of water). For WIPP, previous experiments have measured \(h\) to be \(1585^{+11}_{-6}\) \si{\hecto\g\per\square\cm}\cite{Esch:2004zj}, so this value was used for the simulations. This distribution is a good approximation for \(\theta < \pi/3\).

The energy distribution for muons underground can also be approximated\cite{Gaisser:1990kx}. The distribution for muons at the surface is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_surface_distribution}
\frac{dN}{dE} \propto E^{-2.7}\left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{1.1 E \cos \theta}{115}} + \frac{0.054}{1+\frac{1.1 E \cos \theta}{850}}\right)
\end{equation}
for \(E\) in \si{\GeV}. The flux underground is then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_underground_distribution}
\frac{dN}{dE} = \frac{dN}{dE_0}e^{b h \sec \theta}
\end{equation}
where \(b E\) defines the rate of continuous energy loss for muons. \(b\) is about \SI{4d-6}{\g\per\square\cm} for standard rock. This makes the substitution
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_E0_def}
E_0 = e^{b h \sec \theta}\left(E + \epsilon\right) - \epsilon
\end{equation}
which is the average energy of surface muons that pass through \(h\sec\theta\) of material and emerge with energy \(E\). The parameter \(\epsilon\) is a critical energy above which discrete, radiative energy losses dominate, rather than continuous losses described by \(b\). For standard rock, \(\epsilon\) is about \SI{693}{\GeV}\cite{groom:2001ys}.

Muon events were simulated by first picking an azimuthal angle \(\phi\) uniformly between\(-\pi\) and \(+\pi\) and a zenith angle \(\theta\) from \cref{eq:muon_angular_distribution} multiplied by a factor of \(\cos\theta\) (explained below). The energy was selected in a range of \SIrange{1}{500}{\GeV} from \cref{eq:muon_underground_distribution} for the selected zenith angle. A point was chosen uniformly randomly from a horizontal disk of radius \SI{3}{\m} just below the TPC. This is the reason for the \(\cos\theta\) factor in the angular distribution, since the flux through that disk will be \(\cos\theta\) less than a disk of the same area normal to the incident angle. The \SI{3}{\m} radius ensures the flux will be accurately simulated for \(\theta \lesssim 80^{\circ}\).

A muon was then generated at a height of \SI{3}{\meter} vertically above the plane of the disk with the selected energy and incident angles, and passing through the selected point. To save computation time, only muons that would actually pass through the TPC volume (taken to be a cylinder of radius  \SI{22.74}{\cm}, the interior radius of the TPC, and length \(2\times\)~\SI{20.44}{\cm}, twice the distance from the cathode to the APD plane face) were simulated fully. Positively charged muons were generated in a 1.25 ratio to negatively charged muons, similar to the typical value in nature. The ``standard rock'' values for \(b\) and \(\epsilon\) were used, and the depth \(h\) was varied 5\% around \SI{1585}{\hecto\g\per\square\cm} to account for systematic effects of the angular distribution on efficiency.

\subsection{Reconstruction Accuracy}
For most incident muon angles, the algorithm correctly reconstructs their incident angle. \Cref{fig:muon_misrecon_rate} shows the rate for muons to be misreconstructed more than \ang{5} from their true angle. Several pathologies are visible. As discussed above, muons parallel to the wire plane are poorly reconstructed. Likewise, the angular resolution for near-vertical muons is poor, since hot spots are only identified with a resolution of \SI{1}{\micro\s}. This analysis concentrates on the region with good angular reconstruction. This region is bounded by the polygon with vertices \((\theta,\phi) =\) \{(\ang{24},~\ang{0}), (\ang{24},~\ang{48}), (\ang{28},~\ang{48}), (\ang{28},~\ang{60}), (\ang{40},~\ang{60}), (\ang{40},~\ang{72}), (\ang{72},~\ang{56}), (\ang{60},~\ang{56}), (\ang{60},~\ang{60})\} and their reflection across \(\phi=0\), as well as the symmetric region on the opposite side of the detector. These specific values were chosen to align with the binning used for the analysis.

The top figure shows the rate for  errors greater than \ang{5} in total angular separation. The bottom figure shows the rate for errors greater than \ang{5} in \(\theta\) only, which is of concern because the flux varies in \(\theta\), but is isotropic in \(\phi\). The black polygon indicates the region with good reconstruction used for this analysis. The azimuthal angle is on the horizontal axis, with \ang{3} bins, while the zenith angle is on the vertical axis, with \ang{1} bins. Blank bins had no muons reconstructed in that bin. Poor angular resolution for near-vertical muons leads to the many blank bins at small \(\theta\).}

\subsection{Efficiency}
Overall, of two million simulated muons that hit the TPC, \(1125723\pm1061\text{(stat)}\) were tagged as muons by the algorithm described above. This is an overall efficiency of \(56.3 \pm 0.1\text{(stat)}\)\%. However, the geometry of the detector means that the efficiency will be a function of the incident muon angle. \Cref{fig:muon_efficiency} shows the efficiency of detecting muons based on the ratio of muons reconstructed in an angular bin to muons simulated in that bin. This is useful for estimating the true flux in a bin.

This includes muons incorrectly reconstructed, so that this can be used to estimate a total flux. The region inside the black polygon, used for this analysis, shows reasonable efficiencies. The bin at \((\theta, \phi) = (0, 0)\) is off scale high, with a ratio of \num{5.2d3}, owing to poor angular reconstruction for near-vertical muons, and the degeneracy for muons passing parallel to the wire plane.}

\section{The Muon Flux at WIPP}
\label{sec:muon_wipp}
The muon flux through the detector divided into discrete solid angle bins is simply
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_fluxdef}
\Phi = \frac{\sum_{i}N_{\mu}}{ \Delta T\sum_{i}\Delta\Omega_i \epsilon(\theta_i, \phi_i) A(\theta_i, \phi_i)}
\end{equation}
where \(N_\mu\) is the number of muons observed in time \(\Delta T\). \(\epsilon\) is the efficiency for that bin, \(\Delta\Omega_i\) is the solid angle subtended by bin \(i\), and \(A\) is the projected area of the detector for a particle incident from \((\theta_i, \phi_i)\). The projected area of a cylinder on its side is
\begin{equation}
A(\theta,\phi) = \pi r^2 |\cos(\phi)|\sin(\theta) + 2 r \ell \sqrt{1-\sin(\theta)^2 \cos(\phi)^2}
\end{equation}
where \(r\) is the cylinder's radius and \(\ell\) is its height. The dimensions of the cylinder used were the same as for the simulation (\(r =\)~\SI{22.74}{\cm}, \(\ell=2\times\)\SI{20.44}{\cm}). If the muons were simulated through a larger cylinder, the efficiency would be lower, but the product of area and efficiency would be the same.

The pions and kaons in the atmosphere traveling with large \(\theta\) are more likely to decay to muons than interact as they spend more time in the low-density upper atmosphere. This provides a \(\sec\theta\) enhancement in the flux underground. Therefore, most cosmic ray measurements quote a vertical muon flux:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_vfluxdef}
\Phi_v(\theta, \phi) = \Phi(\theta, \phi)\cos\theta
\end{equation}

Integrating \cref{eq:muon_angular_distribution} over the polygonal region of interest, the ratio of the total flux in the region of interest to the vertical flux is \num{0.553\pm0.020} where the error is found by varying the depth \(h\) by 5\% around \SI{1585}{\hecto\g\per\square\cm}.

To calculate the flux, EXO-200 was divided into \ang{4} bins in \(\theta\) and \ang{12} bins in \(\phi\) to ensure good statistics in each bin. Only bins that had centers in the region of interest were considered. In golden data taken between October 14, 2011 and January 9, 2013, \((11209\pm105.9)\) muons were observed in \SI{2.140d7}{\second}. The integrated product of area, efficiency, and solid angle for bins in the region of interest was \SI{2.35\pm0.01d3}{\square\cm\steradian}. Applying the ratio above to convert this into a total flux yields a vertical flux of
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_vflux_result}
\Phi_v = \left(4.01\pm0.04\text{(stat)}^{+0.04}_{-0.05}\text{(sys)}\right)\times10^{-7}\frac{\text{Hz}}{\text{cm}^2\text{sr}}
\end{equation}

Comparing the vertical muon flux to a global fit\cite{Mei:2006qy} suggests the overburden at WIPP is \(1481^{+8}_{-6}\)~\si{\hecto\g\per\square\cm}. Other global fits\cite{Crouch:1987ij}\cite{miyake:1973} yield consistent results to these.

\subsection{Comparison with Previous Results}
Esch et al.\cite{Esch:2004zj} report a vertical muon flux of \((3.10^{+0.05}_{-0.07})\times10^{-7}\)\si{\Hz\per\square\cm\per\steradian} underground at WIPP. To do so, they deployed at WIPP two parallel scintillator panels, oriented horizontally. Using these panels and subtracting off backgrounds, they measure a flux and then convert it to a vertical flux using the integral of \cref{eq:muon_angular_distribution}. They calculate the ratio to be \(\Phi_v = (0.65\pm0.04)\Phi\). However, computing the ratio yields 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muon_esch_integral}
\frac{\Phi_v}{\Phi} = \frac{2 \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \varphi(h,\theta)\cos\theta\sin\theta d\theta}{2 \pi \int_0^{\pi/2} \varphi(h,\theta)\sin\theta d\theta} = 0.814^{+0.006}_{-0.005}
\end{equation}
where \(\varphi(h,\theta)\) is the distribution in \cref{eq:muon_angular_distribution} and \(h = \)~\SI{1526}{\hecto\gram\per\square\cm} (with the error due to varying this \(\pm10\%\)) as in their paper. The \(\sin\theta\) and \(2 \pi\) factors come from the integral over solid angle.

Furthermore, the paper uses an efficiency of \((88.5\pm0.2)\%\) to calculate their flux, while later quoting an efficiency of \((84.25\pm0.2)\%\). A simple toy Monte Carlo simulation of their geometry with two parallel panels \SI{76.2}{\cm}\(\times\)\SI{305}{\cm} separated by \SI{30.5}{\cm} with muons generated according to \cref{eq:muon_angular_distribution} yields a geometric efficiency of \((80.6^{+1.5}_{-1.6})\%\), with the main error due to uncertainty about which two surfaces are separated by \SI{30.5}{\cm}.

Using their background-subtracted muon count of \(5224^{+89}_{-123}\), their published area of \SI{23225}{\square\cm}, their published running time of \SI{532800}{s}, and the corrected efficiency, their flux becomes \SI{5.24\pm0.10d-7}{\Hz\per\square\cm}. Applying the correct vertical flux ratio, the vertical flux becomes \SI{4.26\pm0.09d-7}{\Hz\per\square\cm\per\steradian} which agrees with the result above in \cref{eq:muon_vflux_result}.
