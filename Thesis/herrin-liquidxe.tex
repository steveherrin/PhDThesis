\chapter[LXe for \(\beta\beta\) decay experiments]{Liquid Xenon for Double Beta Decay Experiments}
\label{ch:liquidxe}

\section{A Xenon Detector}
Xenon has many properties that make it desirable for a double beta decay experiment:
\begin{itemize}
\item First and foremost, xenon can serve as both as the source and detector of double beta decay events. This minimizes the other materials needed to build the detector that might be sources of radioactive backgrounds. Electrons from the double beta decay do not have to pass through other media before reaching the detector, allowing fewer energy losses and better energy resolution.
\item The Q value for \xenon{136} decays is is \SI{2457.8}{\keV}\cite{Redshaw:2007cr}, which is higher that most \(\gamma\) rays from common radioactive nuclides. \isotope{208}{Tl}, which occurs on the thorium chain and emits a \SI{2615}{\keV}gamma ray is the notable exception. \(\gamma\) rays with higher energies than the Q value can potentially deposit part of their energy in the detector before scattering out, creating an event with energy close to the Q value.
\item The natural abundance of \xenon{136} is 8.9\%. Furthermore, xenon is a gas at standard temperatures and pressures, making it simple to process and enrich in \xenon{136} using ultracentrifugation.
\item Xenon is a nobel element, and so it is relatively easy to purify of all chemically active contaminants. Furthermore, this purification can be done continuously by recirculating the xenon.
\item The isotopes formed in xenon by cosmogenic activation are short-lived, so the xenon only needs a short period underground and a chemical purification before it is ready to be used.
\item Xenon can be easily reused and transferred between experiments. This allows the opportunity to use xenon in complimentary or novel detector designs. Smaller experiments can help amortize the cost of larger experiments.
\item The barium daughter ion could potentially be tagged, reducing backgrounds immensely. (This technique, however, is not used in EXO-200.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Measuring Radiation}
\subsection{Ionization}
Radiation depositing energy into xenon creates electron-ion pairs. The average energy needed to create an electron-ion pair is called the \(W\)-value, and is \SI{15.6\pm0.3}{\eV}\cite{Takahashi:1975kx} for liquid xenon. The number of pairs does not follow a Poisson distribution, as might be expected. Rather
\begin{equation}
\left (\Delta N_i \right)^2 = F \bar{N_i}
\end{equation}
where \(\bar{N_i}\) denotes the mean number of electron-ion pairs and \(\Delta N_i\) denotes the standard deviation. \(F\) is known as the Fano factor\cite{Fano:1947ys} and is estimated to be 0.059 in liquid xenon\cite{Doke:1976vn}. This implies the absolutely best possible energy resolution of a liquid xenon detector should be  
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma}{E} = \sqrt{F W E}
\end{equation}
which would be comparable to the energy resolution of \ce{Ge} detectors. However, no liquid xenon experiments to date have come close to this energy resolution, or even that for the Poisson limit. The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear.

\subsection{Scintillation}
Radiation in xenon can directly excite the atoms, in addition to creating electron-ion pairs. These excited atoms  pair with other xenon atoms to create excited dimers, which then emit light when they de-excite:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Xe}^{*} + \text{Xe} + \text{Xe} \rightarrow \text{Xe}^{*}_2 + \text{Xe} \\
\text{Xe}^{*}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Xe} + h\nu
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Additionally, ions and electrons can recombine, which again produces light:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{Xe}^{+} + \text{Xe} \rightarrow \text{Xe}^{+}_2 \\
\text{Xe}^{+}_2 + \text{e}^{-} \rightarrow \text{Xe}^{**} + \text{Xe} \\
\text{Xe}^{**} \rightarrow \text{Xe}^{*} + \text{heat} \\
\text{Xe}^{*} + \text{Xe} + \text{Xe} \rightarrow \text{Xe}^{*}_2 + \text{Xe} \\
\text{Xe}^{*}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Xe} + h\nu
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The light produced in xenon is in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectrum, and in liquid xenon, the emission peaks at \SI{177.6}{\nm}. Xenon is transparent at this wavelength. The scintillation is prompt, with the excited dimers decaying with a decay time of \SIrange{2}{4}{\ns} for the singlet state and \SIrange{20}{25}{\ns} for the triplet state. The exact decay time depends on the type of radiation\cite{Aprile:2010uq}.

\subsection{Combining Ionization and Scintillation}

\caption[Anticorrelated Energy Resolution in Liquid Xenon]{A toy example of how the energy resolution of a monoenergetic line can be improved by combining signals in liquid xenon. The ionization signal (top left) and the scintillation signal (top right) show poor energy resolution individually. When the signals are anticorrelated (shown bottom left, with coefficient -0.8), they can be protected onto a rotated axis to yield an improved energy resolution (bottom right).}

\end{figure}

Electron-ion pairs can recombine to produce one scintillation photon. The probability for this to occur depends both on the ionization density and the strength of the electric field applied, since a stronger field will cause more electrons to drift away from the ions before they can recombine. While this can be modeled\cite{Doke:1988qf}\cite{Thomas:1987ve}, collecting both ionization and scintillation signals allows an unambiguous measurement of the total energy deposited in the detector.

A toy example of combining the ionization and scintillation signals is shown in \cref{fig:lxe_toy_anticorrelation}. Even assuming a less-than-perfect correlation between ionization and scintillation due to effects such as imperfect collection and detector noise, this example shows how combining the signals can yield a dramatic improvement in resolution. This has been demonstrated to work in practice\cite{Conti:2003tg}\cite{Aprile:2007hc}. However, the energy resolution for the combined signals in such experiments still falls short of the Poisson limit, suggesting other factors contribute to smearing the energy resolution in liquid xenon.

The ratio of the ionization and scintillation signals varies with changing electric field, since a stronger electric field draws more electron-ion pairs apart before they can recombine. Additionally, the two channels may have different signal levels due to imperfect collection, and different noise levels due if different instruments are used to measure them. As such, the combination of ionization and scintillation that optimizes energy resolution will vary from experiment to experiment.

\section{Radiopurity}
Liquid xenon is dense (\about~\SI{3}{\g\per\cubic\cm}) and has a high atomic-number (\(Z=54\)). It provides good shielding against low-energy \(\gamma\) rays. The attenuation length of a \SI{100}{keV} photon is less than \SI{2}{\mm}\cite{Berger:2010dq}. However, this shielding grows worse for higher-energy photon. A \SI{1}{MeV} photon has an attenuation length of nearly \SI{6}{\cm}, and so the self-shielding is less useful for a double-beta decay search.

Since xenon is a nobel gas, nearly all radioactive impurities can be removed chemically. However, \isotope{85}{Kr} (a \(\beta^{-}\) emitter primarily produced as a byproduct to nuclear fission) and isotopes of \ce{Rn} (naturally occurring due to \ce{U} and \ce{Th} decays) are potential trace backgrounds. Krypton can be removed through distillation or ultracentrifugation. Since many decays occur along the full radon chains, there is some potential to tag these decays. Cosmogenic \xenon{135} and \xenon{137} can be mitigated by a rock overburden to provide shielding from cosmic rays, and are in any case short-lived. Double beta decays of the even-numbered nuclei will always be a background, of course.
