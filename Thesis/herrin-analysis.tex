\section{Event Selection}
\subsection{Timing-based Vetoes}
In order to reduce backgrounds (described in \cref{sec:muon_motivation}) due to cosmic-ray muons, two cuts are applied to the data:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events that occur within \SI{0.1}{\s} of a hit in a muon veto system panel are cut.
\item Events that occur within \SI{10}{\s} of a muon passing through the TPC (identified by the method in \cref{ch:muons}) are cut.
\end{itemize}
These cuts are designed to remove as many cosmogenic background events as possible while not cutting a portion of the detector live time so large that the trade-off in signal-to-background ratio is not worth it. The TPC muon cut removes X.X\% of the live time, while the muon veto system panel cut removes X.X\% of the live time. Since these are often coincident, the total impact is X.X\%.\todo{Get the final numbers for these.}

Events occurring near each other in time are likely to be due to a decay of some radioactive contaminant, followed by another decay of a short-lived daughter. For example, the \isotope{222}{Rn} daughter \isotope{214}{Bi} \(\beta^{-}\) decays to \isotope{214}{Po}, which then \(\alpha\) decays with a \SI{164}{\micro\s} half-life.  Events with more than one scintillation signal identified are cut for this reason. Furthermore, any event is vetoed if it occurs within \SI{\pm1}{\s} of another event. The dead-time incurred is X.X\%.

All the liquid xenon within the teflon reflectors and between the anodes is ``active''. That is, ionization and scintillation in the active region are collected. However, in order to reduce backgrounds from detector materials, and in order to ensure uniform detector response, only events within a fiducial volume. This fiducial volume is a right hexagonal prism. The hexagon is coaxial with the detector and has apothem \SI{153}{\mm}. In each TPC, it begins \SI{15}{\mm} away from the cathode and extends to \SI{182}{\mm} (which is \SI{10.2}{\mm} from the \(v\) wire plane). \Cref{fig:analysis_fiducial_volume} provides an illustration. The total volume is \SI{27.1}{\litre}, which contains \SI{81.9}{\kg} of liquid xenon.
